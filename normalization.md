Entities
User

Potential Redundancies and Violations
User Table:

All attributes are dependent on user_id, so it complies with 1NF and 2NF. No transitive dependencies are found.
Property Table:

All attributes are dependent on property_id. No transitive dependencies are present.
Booking Table:

The total_price might depend on property_id and the duration of the stay (end_date - start_date). This could be seen as a transitive dependency.
Payment Table:

All attributes are dependent on payment_id. No transitive dependencies are present.
Review Table:

All attributes are dependent on review_id. No transitive dependencies found.
Message Table:

All attributes are dependent on message_id. No transitive dependencies are present.
Adjustments to Achieve 3NF
To achieve 3NF, we need to address the potential transitive dependency in the Booking table related to total_price.

Steps Taken
Remove total_price from the Booking Table:

Instead of storing total_price in the Booking table, we can calculate it dynamically based on the propertyâ€™s price per night and the duration of the stay.
This can be done using a query whenever needed.
Revised Schema:

User: No changes needed.
Property: No changes needed.
Booking:
Attributes: booking_id, property_id, user_id, start_date, end_date, status, created_at
Payment: No changes needed.
Review: No changes needed.
Message: No changes needed.
