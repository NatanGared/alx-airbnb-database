Explanation of Key Components
Data Types: Each column is assigned a data type that best fits the data it will hold (e.g., VARCHAR, UUID, DECIMAL, TIMESTAMP).
Primary Keys: Each table has a primary key defined using PRIMARY KEY.
Foreign Keys: Relationships between tables are established using FOREIGN KEY constraints to maintain referential integrity.
Constraints: Various constraints such as NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and CHECK are applied to ensure data validity.
Indexes: An index is created on the email field in the User table for optimized search performance.
